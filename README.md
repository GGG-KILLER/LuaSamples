# Lua Samples
This repository is a repository with samples from multiple Lua usages/versions.

We use this repo to make decisions on how the most common formatting for a given Lua construct is, how common feature X is used as well as testing the main Loretta library for correctness and performance (although these tests are, and will remain for now, manual).

WE DO NOT OWN NOR ARE RELATED TO NOR ENDORSED BY ANY OF THE PROJECTS WE USE AS SAMPLES. The license in this repo only applies to our own code and NOT any submodules.

## On How We Choose the Repos
They are chosen by popularity mostly and when I have someone who is part of a community I ask said person for suggestions.

Currently, we have a limit of 10 repos for each Lua distribution/version/flavor.

To be chosen, the repos must have a minimum of 25 stars (although the more, the better, not a very good indication of popularity but the one that is "universal") and must not be archived.
